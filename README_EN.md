# COLABORATIVE WEDDING GIFT LIST

## Description

When we decided to get married, we chose to have a ceremony in another state, so we wouldn't be able to take the gifts to our home.
Therefore, we had the idea of creating a collaborative wedding gift list.

The idea is that the couple can create a gift list and share it with the guests, who can choose a gift to give by purchasing directly from the suggested store. This way, the couple won't risk receiving duplicate or unwanted gifts. Alternatively, guests can choose to give a monetary gift via Pix.
